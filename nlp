# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('disaster_tweets.csv')  # Replace with your dataset

# Brief Problem/Data Description
## Describe the problem you are trying to solve and the dataset you are working with.

# EDA Procedure
## Exploratory Data Analysis
## Basic statistics, data visualization, etc.

# Data Preprocessing
## Text cleaning, tokenization, etc.

# Feature Engineering
## TF-IDF vectorization

# Model Building and Training
## Split the data into training and testing sets
X = data['text']
y = data['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Train a model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Results
## Model evaluation on the test set
X_test_tfidf = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
confusion = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Discussion/Conclusion
## Summarize the results, discuss insights, and conclude your analysis.

# Save the model (if necessary)
# joblib.dump(model, 'disaster_model.pkl')

# Save the report as a PDF or HTML file (if necessary)
# You can use libraries like nbconvert to convert the Jupyter Notebook to a PDF or HTML file.

# Save the notebook
